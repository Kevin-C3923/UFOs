# UFOs

### Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis was to create an interactive webpage about UFO sighting using information from a javascript file.

### Results

When a user starts using the webpage that individual would likely start off using either the Enter State or Enter Country input to see if any UFO sighting as they are very broad and would provide the most information. In this example we use California for Enter State.

After the user finds results using either of these two methods, they would get more specific in there selection. Therefor, the user would use the last three inputs, Enter Date, Enter City, or Enter Shape. In this example, we already have California entered but we going to find any results in San Diego for Enter City.

### Summary

The webpage does a great job to get the information from the javascript file and adding the different inputs allows the user to get specific results. However, there are some issues with the search method. If a user does not know how to spell a city, as an example, or if that city is even on this list the user will continuously be entering blank tables. 

Two ways to fix this issue is to have either have the input box not be case sensitive or have a drop down menu that shows the closes word that you are typing. So for the case sensitive if I want to find information from the state New Jersey, instead of only typing "nj" I have the option to type Nj, nJ or NJ and that will still give me the same results as if I typed "nj". For the drop down menu, if I want to find the city of san diego, instead of typing out the full name I would be able to just type "san" and it would give me the closest word to what already typed in which can click on it to get that results.
